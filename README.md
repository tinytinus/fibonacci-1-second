# fibonacci-1-second
my quest to calculate the highest fibonacci number i can in 1 second

this whole project started when i was getting some code rojects to do in the summer and found a video about calculating fibonacci numbers in 1 second. 
this intruiged me and i started trying, first in c but that had some problems with the length of the charchters and then in python

python worked like a charm with some small fixes and tinkering i got reasonable results

## results in python

| time calc | print | length |
| --------- | ----- | ------ |
| 1         | 0,33  | 59540  |
| 2         | 0,66  | 86680  |
| 3         | 1,03  | 105490 |
| 4         | 1,35  | 124450 |
| 5         | 1,68  | 137790 |
| 6         | 2,06  | 152200 |
| 7         | 2,43  | 165230 |
| 8         | 2,87  | 176770 |
| 9         | 3,28  | 184820 |
| 10        | 3,47  | 197450 |
|           |       |        |
| 20        | 6,98  | 283220 |
| 40        | 13,89 | 392020 |
| 60        | 21,08 | 494370 |
| 80        | 28,05 | 570270 |
| 100       | 36,06 | 639790 |

the first colunm is the time given for the calculations, the second column is the time it took to print in my terminal and the third is the length of the fibonacci number

if we put these in graphs we get these

on the left we have the print time, bottom time calc and right length number

reminder this is all on a shitty chromebook
